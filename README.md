# AnimeGanAndroid

Porting the AnimeGan2 Model to Android and making a simple demo.

The AnimeGan2 demo is based on the AnimeGan2 for @bryandlee which can be found here: PyTorch model by https://github.com/bryandlee/animegan2-pytorch

GPU currently doesn't work due to an operator error.  I'll happily accept a PR that fixes this, because it'd be interesting to see how this works on GPU.  The GAN takes just under six seconds to run.

This is unpolished demo code for a conference.  "Conference Driven Development"
